The selected configuration may or may not achieve stable PRBS-based link in loopback, due to its use
of either a disabled or custom comma, modified comma mask, channel bonding sequence(s), or clock
correction sequence(s). When using these features, user-specified bit patterns cause feature-specific
behavior that may periodically disrupt the data stream due to coincidental matches of the provided
PRBS pattern, causing checker mismatches and resulting in no, or lost lock. The IP core therefore
disables checking of the PRBS-based link status within this simulation testbench. This simulation will
simply run for a short period of time and then end with a test completed successfully message, but it
should not be construed to mean that data integrity was observed in this configuration. You may wish
to extend this simulation period to observe actual behavior, which is not predictable by this IP core.
